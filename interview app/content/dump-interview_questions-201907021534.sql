INSERT INTO `angular` VALUES (NULL,7,'What are the new features of Angular2?','Angular 2 is written entirely in Typescript and meets the ECMAScript 6 specification.\r\n\r\nComponent-Based- Angular 2 is entirely component based. Controllers and $scope are no longer used. They have been replaced by components and directives.\r\n\r\nDirectives- The specification for directives is considerably simplified, although they are still subject to change. With the @Directive annotation, a directive can be declared.\r\n\r\nDependency Injection- Because of the improved dependency injection model in Angular2 there are more opportunities for component / object-based work.\r\nUse of TypeScript-TypeScript is a typed super set of JavaScript which has been built and maintained by Microsoft and chosen by the AngularJS team for development. \r\n\r\nThe presence of types makes the code written in TypeScript less prone to run-time errors. In recent times, the support for ES6 has been greatly improved and a few features from ES7 have been added as well.\r\n\r\nGenerics- TypeScript has generics which can be used in the frontend.\r\nLambdas with TypeScript- In TypeScript, lambdas are available.\r\nForms and Validations- Forms and validations are an important aspect of frontend development. Within Angular 2 the Form Builder and Control Group are defined.\r\n\r\n\r\n',1),(NULL,7,'How can we achieve Internationalization using Angular 2 ?','It can be achieved using the directive i18n. Internationalization (or i18n, which stands for i--n) is the process of adapting software and web applications to multiple languages, allowing their application to be used by multiple language-speaking users. \r\n\r\nBy ensuring that your application supports multiple languages, you can reach a broader audience and ensure a smooth user experience for multilingual users.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n',1),(NULL,7,'HOW TO SET HTTP REQUEST HEADER IN ANGULAR 4 AND ANGULAR 2?','The HTTP Interceptors are used to Set Http Headers Request in Angular 4 using the import from â€œ@angular/common/httpâ€?. The HTTP Interceptors are available in Angular 4.x versions.\r\n\r\nThe HTTP Interceptors are not supported in Angular 2. We are creating the HttpClient Injectable class to achieve this. You can see the below examples for set http headers request with and without HTTP interceptors.\r\n\r\n\r\n',2),(NULL,7,'WHAT IS THE USE OF INTERCEPTORS IN ANGULAR 4?','The Interceptors is a common used to set default headers for all responses.\r\n\r\n\r\n',2),(NULL,7,'WHAT IS THE FORROOT METHOD?','The forRoot is a static method and itâ€™s very easy for developers to configure the modules and the best example is â€“ RouterModule.forRoot.\r\n\r\nThe RouterModule also offers a forChild.

The forRoot and forChild are the traditional names for methods that configure services in root.\r\n\r\n\r\n',2),(NULL,7,'WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN `{`NGFOR`}` AND `{`NGFOROF`}` IN ANGULAR 2?','Angular 2 â€“ ngFor vs. ngForOf\r\n\r\nThe [ngFor] is not a type safe\r\nThe [NgForOf] is a type Safe\r\nThe [NgFor] directive instantiates a template once per item from iterate\r\nThe [ngFor] and [ngForOf] are actually the selectors of the [NgForOf] directive and it is not two distinct things\r\nThe [ngFor] will be works like as collections\r\nThe [ngForOf] will be works like as generics\r\n\r\n\r\n',2),(NULL,7,'WHAT CLASSES SHOULD I ADD TO MODULE\'S DECLARATIONS?','We can add the declarable classes like components, directives and pipes in the moduleâ€™s declarations list and we can add only â€“ components, directives and pipes classes in the @NgModule.\r\n\r\n\r\n',2),(NULL,7,'WHAT CLASSES SHOULD I NOT ADD TO MODULE\'S DECLARATIONS?','We do not declare â€“ Module, Service, objects, strings, numbers, functions, entity models, configurations, business logic, and helper classes in the moduleâ€™s declarations.\r\n\r\n\r\n',2),(NULL,7,'WHAT HAPPEN WHEN I IMPORT THE SAME MODULE TWICE IN ANGULAR 4?','No problem! We can import the same module twice but Angular does not like modules with circular references.\r\n\r\nSo do not let Module â€œXâ€? import Module â€œYâ€? which already imports Module â€œXâ€?.\r\n\r\nWhen four modules all import Module â€œXâ€?, Angular estimate Module â€œXâ€? once, the first time face it and does not do again. Actually, the modules help us to organize an application into associative blocks of functionality.\r\n\r\n\r\n',2),(NULL,7,'HOW TO GET AND LOG AN ERROR IN ANGULAR 4?','Two types of errors â€“\r\n\r\nIf the backend returns an unsuccessful response like â€“ 404, 500 and so on\r\nIf something goes wrong in the client side like -network error etc.\r\nIn the both cases â€“ We are using HttpErrorResponse and return the useful information on what went wrong in this call!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n',2),(NULL,7,'HOW ARE JWTS USED TO AUTHENTICATE ANGULAR 4 APPLICATIONS?','In Annular, the following Steps are used to building authentication and authorization for RESTful APIs and applications. It might help you â€“\r\n\r\nThe users send their credentials to the server which is verified by the database credentials. If everything is verified successfully, the JWT is sent back to them.\r\nThe JWT is saved in the userâ€™s browser in local storage or in a cookie and so on.\r\nThe presence of a JWT saved in the browser is used as an indicator that a user is currently logged in.\r\nThe expiry time of JWT is continually checked to maintain an authenticated state in the Angular applications.\r\nThe client side routes are protected and access by authenticated users only.\r\nWhen user sends the XHR requests for APIs, the JWT gets sent an Authorization header using your cookies or Bearer.\r\n\r\nWhen XHR requests coming on the server, before send back the responses itâ€™s validated first with configured appâ€™s secret keys. If everything is looking good then returns successfully responses other send the back to the bad request.\r\n\r\nThere are several open source libraries are available for angular which are helps with JWTs and has the ability to Decode the JWT, Authorization header to XHR requests and so on.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n',2),(NULL,7,'WHAT IS JSON WEB TOKEN?','JSON Web Token (JWT) is an open standard which used for securely transmitting information between parties as a JSON object.\r\n\r\nThe JWTs can be signed with â€“\r\n\r\nHMAC algorithm\r\nRSA algorithm\r\n\r\n\r\n',2),(NULL,7,'What is component in Angular 2 ?','In Angular, a Component is a special kind of directive that uses a simpler configuration which is suitable for a component-based application structure.\r\n\r\n\r\n',1),(NULL,7,'WHEN SHOULD YOU USE JSON WEB TOKENS?','There are some scenarios where we can used JSON Web Tokens â€“\r\n\r\nAuthentication\r\nInformation Exchange\r\n\r\n\r\n',2),(NULL,7,'WHAT IS THE JSON WEB TOKEN STRUCTURE?','The JSON Web Tokens consist of three parts separated by dots (.), which are:\r\n\r\nHeader\r\nPayload\r\nSignature\r\n\r\n\r\n',2),(NULL,7,'What is @Inputs in Angular 2? ?','@Input allows you to pass data into your controller and templates through html and defining custom properties. \r\n\r\nThis allows you to easily reuse components and have them display different values for each instance of the renderer.\r\n\r\n\r\n',1),(NULL,7,' What is @Outputs in Angular?','Components push out events using a combination of an @Output and an EventEmitter. \r\n\r\nThis allows a clean separation between reusable Components and application logic.\r\n\r\n\r\n',1),(NULL,7,'What are differences between Components and Directives?','Components :\r\n\r\nFor register component we use @Component meta-data annotation.\r\n\r\nComponent is a directive which use shadow DOM to create encapsulate visual behavior called components. Components are typically used to create UI widgets.\r\n\r\nComponent is used to break up the application into smaller components.\r\n\r\nOnly one component can be present per DOM element.\r\n\r\n\r\n@View decorator or templateurl template are mandatory in the component.\r\n\r\nDirectives :\r\n\r\nFor register directives we use @Directive meta-data annotation.\r\n\r\nDirectives is used to add behavior to an existing DOM element.\r\n\r\nDirective is use to design re-usable components.\r\n\r\nMany directive can be used in a per DOM element.\r\n\r\nDirective donâ€™t have View.\r\n\r\n\r\n',1),(NULL,7,'What is primeng?

PrimeNG is developed by PrimeTek Informatics, a company with years of expertise in developing open source UI components. \r\n\r\nAngularJS makes it possible to use predefined components for development like tables etc. This helps developers save time and efforts. Using PrimeNG developers can create awesome applications in no time.\r\n\r\n\r\n',1),(NULL,7,'What is Angular 2','Angular 2 is a JavaScript framework for developing web applications.\r\nIt is a complete rewrite of Angular 1.0 ,so learning AngularJS 1.0 is not required for creating Angular 2 applications.\r\n\r\nIt is well suited for developing mobile applications unlike AngularJS 1.0 which was suitable for building desktop applications.It is also much faster than Angular 1.0.\r\n\r\nIt supports the modern browsers as well as the older browsers.Applications are better structured than previous versions of Angular.It supports server side rendering for faster rendering of views even on slow devices such as mobile.\r\n\r\nThe size of Angular 2 library is smaller compared to previous versions.Also Angular 2 applications use ahead of time compilation which makes them faster.\r\n\r\n\r\n',1),(NULL,7,'Which languages are used to write Angular 2 applications','Angular 2 applications can be written in any of the following languages:\r\n\r\nTypescript   Prefered Language for developing Angular 2 applications.\r\nJavascript\r\nDart\r\nWe donâ€™t have to worry about the JavaScript or ECMAScript version as its the compilerâ€™s responsibility to manage the version issues.\r\n\r\nAs Angular 2 is written in TypeScript so it is preferable to write Angular 2 applications in TypeScript or ECMA6. Typescript is the prefered language to use for developing Angular 2 applications.\r\n\r\n\r\n',1),(NULL,7,'Components','A component is a building block of Angular 2 application.Angular 2 application is created as a tree of components.A component is declared by using @Component() decorator function.\r\n\r\n\r\n@Component({\r\nselector: \'first-component\',\r\ntemplate: `<p>Hello from first component</p>`\r\n})\r\nexport class FirstComponent {\r\n}\r\n\r\nWhen we declare Component we define metadata for component.In this example we have defined selector and template metadata for the FirstComponent component.\r\n\r\n\r\n',1),(NULL,7,'Modules','Angular apps consists of different modules.Modules consists of collection of components,directives and services.\r\n\r\nAngular modules are created using the NgModules() decorator function.\r\nEvery Angular application consists of a root module apart from other feature modules.Every modules is created using NgModule decorator function.\r\n\r\n\r\n',1),(NULL,7,'What is the need of Angular2?','Angular 2 is not just a typical upgrade but a totally new development. The whole framework is rewritten from the ground. Angular 2 got rid of many things like $scope, controllers, DDO, jqLite, angular.module etc. \r\n\r\nIt uses components for almost everything. Imagine that even the whole app is now a component. \r\n\r\nAlso it takes advantage of ES6 / TypeScript syntax. Developing Angular 2 apps in TypeScript has made it even more powerful. . Apart from that, many things have evolved and re-designed like the template engine and many more.\r\n\r\n',1),(NULL,7,'Template','View of a component is declared by using the template.It is the template which is rendered.\r\n\r\nWe can define template in line in the component template metadata property:\r\n\r\n\r\n@Component({\r\nselector: \'hello-component\',\r\ntemplate: \'{{Hello}}\'\r\n})\r\nWe can also define templates in separate html file and use the templateUrl property in component:\r\n\r\n\r\n@Component({\r\nselector: \'hello-component\',\r\ntemplateUrl: \'./hello.html\'\r\n})\r\n\r\n\r\n',1),(NULL,7,'Data bindings which are supported in Angular 2','Interpolation   In interpolation binding we specify the binding using

Angular2','Angular 2 application is a collection of modules and components.There are two ways we can load Modules:\r\n\r\nEager Module loading  Loading module at application startup\r\nLazy loading  Loading Module only when required\r\nModule which is required can be loaded instead of loading all the modules at application initialization.This has the obvious advantage of improving the application startup time.\r\n\r\nWe enable lazy loading in Angular 2 by using the loadChildren property in route\r\n\r\n1\r\n{ path: \'URL\', loadChildren: \'modulePath#ClassName\' }\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n',1),(NULL,7,'AOT compilation','AOT compilation stands for  Ahead Of Time compilation, in it angular compiles  components to native JavaScript and HTML during the build time instead of runtime.\r\n\r\nThis drastically improves the performance of the Angular 2 application.With Just in time compilation ,the compilation happens on the users browser at runtime.\r\n\r\nIn the case of Ahead of time compilation ,the application is compiled and optimized at the build time instead of run time.So this improves the rendering of the application UI.This approach should be used in production builds.\r\n\r\n\r\n',1),(NULL,7,'Why AngualrJS2 over AngualrJS1?','Angular 2 is simpler and faster than Angular 1.\r\nYou can update the large data sets with minimal memory overhead.\r\nIt

This is much easier and much straight forward.\r\n\r\nsystemjs: This is the traditional way of developing angularjs application. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n',1),(NULL,7,'What are the main routing COMPONENTS?','Angular2 provides 3 different components for routing configuration:\r\n\r\nRoutes is the configuration to describe applicationâ€™s different routes\r\nRouterOutlet is a â€œplaceholderâ€? component that holds the view for each route\r\nRouterLink is a directive to link to routes\r\nRoutes:\r\nRoutes is an object to describe the routes of the application. For instance, here is an example for our previously specified goal.\r\n\r\n\r\nconst routes: Routes  = [\r\n { path: \'\', redirectTo: \'login\', pathMatch:\'full\' },\r\n { path: \'login\', component: LoginComponent },\r\n { path: \'home\', component: HomeComponent ,\r\n  children: [\r\n   { path: \'\', component: DashBoardComponent },\r\n   {path: \'events\', component: EventsComponent}\r\n  ]},\r\n { path: \'register\', component: RegisterComponent },\r\n { path: \'about\', component: AboutComponent },\r\n { path: \'**\', component: p404Component },\r\n];\r\n1\r\n2\r\n3\r\n4\r\n5\r\n6\r\n7\r\n8\r\n9\r\n10\r\n11\r\n12\r\nconst routes: Routes  = [\r\n { path: \'\', redirectTo: \'login\', pathMatch:\'full\' },\r\n { path: \'login\', component: LoginComponent },\r\n { path: \'home\', component: HomeComponent ,\r\n  children: [\r\n   { path: \'\', component: DashBoardComponent },\r\n   {path: \'events\', component: EventsComponent}\r\n  ]},\r\n { path: \'register\', component: RegisterComponent },\r\n { path: \'about\', component: AboutComponent },\r\n { path: \'**\', component: p404Component },\r\n];\r\nWe have configure routes which is an array of Route. Each entry of the array is  The complete list of possible fields used in this configuration are as following:\r\n\r\npath â€“ url of the route used by the matcher DSL.\r\ncomponent â€“name of the target component.\r\npathMatch â€“ specifies the matching strategy, example : full.\r\nredirectTo -url that will replace the current matched segment in case of redirection.\r\noutlet â€“ name of the outlet used as a placeholder for the component. If there is no outlet it would be placed in <router-outlet>\r\ncanActivate â€“ array of DI tokens used to find CanActivate handlers.\r\ncanActivateChild â€“ array of DI tokens used to find CanActivateChild handlers.\r\ncanDeactivate â€“ array of DI tokens used to find CanDeactivate handlers.\r\ndata is additional data provided to the component via ActivatedRoute.\r\nresolve is a map of DI tokens used to look up data resolvers.\r\nchildren is an array used to define nested routes.\r\nRouter Directives\r\nAngular RouterModule has 3 different directives. Such as:\r\n\r\nrouter-outlet\r\nrouter-link\r\nrouterLinkActive\r\nrouter-outlet:\r\n\r\nrouter-outlet is a component from angular/router library. The router is the placeholder to display views inside  <router-outlet> tags. As the routes changes, the view inside the <router-outlet> tags also change accordingly.\r\n\r\n\r\n<div class=\"container-fluid\">\r\n        <router-outlet></router-outlet>\r\n</div>\r\n1\r\n2\r\n3\r\n<div class=\"container-fluid\">\r\n        <router-outlet></router-outlet>\r\n</div>\r\nrouter-link:\r\n\r\nrouter-link directive is an alternative of HTML href property. The syntax is as following:\r\n\r\n\r\n<a [routerLink]=\"[\'/url\']\">Url Title</a>\r\n1\r\n<a [routerLink]=\"[\'/url\']\">Url Title</a>\r\nrouter-link directive can also handle query parameter. For example, once we land in /hoem/events page, it shows a list of events , if we want to go to directly one of the events page, we can just put the iid of that specific event and can land of the event details page for event 01. For this purpose, we use [queryParams] binding. [queryParams] takes an object such as {â€˜idâ€™:01} and can\r\n\r\nFirstly, We have bound router-link directive to events array as following:\r\n\r\n\r\n<a [routerLink]=\"[\'/home/events]\">Events</a>\r\n1\r\n<a [routerLink]=\"[\'/home/events]\">Events</a>\r\nNow inside app.router.ts we have configure the queryParams binding as following:\r\n\r\n\r\nthis.router.navigate([\'/home/events\', event.id]);\r\n1\r\nthis.router.navigate([\'/home/events\', event.id]);\r\nOtherwise, if we want to pass the queryParams in an object , we can also do that as following:\r\n\r\n\r\n<a [routerLink]=\"[\'/home/events, { id: \'event01\' }]\">Event 01 </a>\r\n\r\n<a [routerLink]=\"[\'/home/events, { id: \'event01\' }]\">Event 01 </a>\r\nOR\r\n\r\n\r\n<a [routerLink]=\"[\'/home/events, 1]\">Event 1</a>\r\n\r\n<a [routerLink]=\"[\'/home/events, 1]\">Event 1</a>\r\n\r\nrouterLinkActive:\r\n\r\nThe RouterLinkActive directive toggles css classes for active RouterLinks based on the current RouterState. This cascades down through each level in our route tree, so parent and child router links can be active at the same time. To override this behavior, we can bind to the [routerLinkActiveOptions] input binding with the { exact: true } expression. By using { exact: true }, a given RouterLink will only be active if its URL is an exact match to the current URL.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n',1),(NULL,7,'Metadata in Angularjs 2:','In Angular2.0, different decorators are used to pass variables to class.

However, from performance point of view this has been changed dramatically.\r\n\r\nThere are two types of data binding available in angular 2.0\r\n\r\nOne way\r\nTwo way\r\nHowever, any variable is available within the scope of the component and they can be passed from one component to another component. This way, one of the significant concentration that developed used to give in case of variable declaration in angular 1.x has become much simpler.\r\n\r\n\r\n',1),(NULL,7,' What is @NgModule?','@NgModule is a decorator function. A decorator function allows users to mark something as Angular 2 thing (could be a module or component or something else) and it enables you to provide additional data that determines how this Angular 2 thing will be processed, instantiated and used at the runtime. So, whenever user writes @NgModule, it tells the Angular 2 module, whatâ€™s going to be included and used in and using this module.\r\n\r\n\r\n',1),(NULL,7,'Briefly explain Event Binding in Angular 2?','Angular 2 has been developed to be more synchronized with modern HTML5. Therefore, events has been changed to bind to the DOM API Events with similar syntax.\r\n\r\nFor example, ng-click has been replaced with (click). Same as ng-submit has been changed to  (submit). () parenthesis has been used as the sytax for event emitter.\r\n\r\n//Angularjs 1.x\r\n<div ng-click=\"eventName()\"></div>\r\n//Angular 2.0\r\n<div (click)=\" eventName ()\"></div>\r\n \r\nRespective event object can also be passed as HTML5.

You can see the below examples for set http headers request with and without HTTP interceptors.\r\n\r\nWhat Is the Use of Interceptors in Angular 4?\r\nThe Interceptors is a common used to set default headers for all responses.\r\n\r\nExample 1 â€“  For Angular 4\r\n\r\nSet Headers Http Request Using Http Interceptors -\r\nThe HTTP Interceptors are now available via using the new HttpClient from angular/common/http in the Angular 4.x versions.\r\n\r\nSteps 1 - Writing an interceptor for adds a header for every request!\r\nimport {HttpEvent, HttpInterceptor, HttpHandler, HttpRequest} from \'@angular/common/http\';\r\n\r\nexport class AddHttpHeaderInterceptor implements HttpInterceptor {\r\n  intercept(req: HttpRequest<any>, next: HttpHandler): Observable<HttpEvent<any>> {\r\n    // Get the auth header from the service.\r\n    const authHeader = \'token_value\';\r\n    const clonedReq = req.clone({headers: req.headers.set(\'Authorization\', authHeader)});\r\n\r\n    return next.handle(clonedReq);\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\nSteps 2 - Providing your interceptor!\r\n- After creating the interceptor, we need to register it using the HTTP_INTERCEPTORS in the @NgModule()\r\n\r\nimport { HTTP_INTERCEPTORS } from \'@angular/common/http\';\r\n\r\n@NgModule({\r\n  providers: [{\r\n    provide: HTTP_INTERCEPTORS,\r\n    useClass: AddHttpHeaderInterceptor,\r\n    multi: true,\r\n  }],\r\n})\r\n\r\nexport class AppModule {}\r\n\r\nExample 2-  For Angular 2\r\n\r\nSet Headers Http Request without HTTP Interceptors  -\r\n\r\nSteps 1 â€“ We are creating the HttpClient Injectable class.\r\nimport {Injectable} from \'@angular/core\';\r\nimport {Http, Headers} from \'@angular/http\';\r\n\r\n@Injectable()\r\nexport class HttpClient {\r\n  constructor(private http: Http) {}\r\n\r\n  createAuthHeader(headers: Headers) {\r\n    headers.append(\'Content-Type\', \'application/json\');\r\n    headers.append(\'Authorization\', \'Basic \' + btoa(\'user-name:password\')); \r\n  }\r\n\r\n  get(url) {\r\n    let headers = new Headers();\r\n    this.createAuthHeader(headers);\r\n\r\n    return this.http.get(url, {headers: headers});\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  post(url, data) {\r\n    let headers = new Headers();\r\n    this.createAuthHeader(headers);\r\n\r\n    return this.http.post(url, data, {headers: headers});\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  put(url, data) {\r\n    let headers = new Headers();\r\n    this.createAuthHeader(headers);\r\n\r\n    return this.http.put(url, data, {headers: headers});\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\nSteps 2 - Injecting the HttpClient object in the Component\r\nimport { HttpClient } from \'../http-client\';\r\n\r\nexport class userComponent {\r\n  constructor(http: HttpClient) {\r\n    this.http = httpClient;\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  getUsers() {\r\n    this.http.get(url).subscribe(data =>{console.log(data); });\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  addUsers(user) {\r\n    this.http.post(url, user).subscribe(data =>{console.log(data); });\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n',2),(NULL,7,'Whatâ€™s New in Angular 4? AND what are the Improvements in Angular 4?','Angular 4 contains some additional Enhancement and Improvement. Consider the following enhancements.\r\n\r\n1.    Smaller & Faster Apps\r\n2.    View Engine Size Reduce\r\n3.    Animation Package\r\n4.    NgIf and ngFor Improvement\r\n5.    Template\r\n6.    NgIf with Else\r\n7.    Use of AS keyword\r\n8.    Pipes\r\n9.    HTTP Request Simplified\r\n10. Apps Testing Simplified\r\n11. Introduce Meta Tags\r\n12. Added some Forms Validators Attributes\r\n13. Added Compare Select Options\r\n14. Enhancement in Router\r\n15. Added Optional Parameter\r\n16. Improvement Internationalization\r\n\r\n1. Smaller & Faster Apps - Angular 4 applications is smaller & faster in comparison with Angular 2.\r\n\r\n2. View Engine Size Reduce - Some changes under to hood to what AOT generated code compilation that means in Angular 4, improved the compilation time. These changes reduce around 60% size in most cases.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3. Animation Package- Animations now have their own package i.e. @angular/platform-browser/animations\r\n\r\n4. Improvement - Some Improvement on *ngIf and *ngFor.\r\n\r\nStayed Informed â€“ Angular 2 vs. Angular 1\r\n\r\n5. Template - The template is now ng-template. You should use the â€œng-templateâ€? tag instead of â€œtemplateâ€?. Now Angular has its own template tag that is called â€œng-templateâ€?.\r\n\r\n6. NgIf with Else â€“ Now in Angular 4, possible to use an else syntax as,\r\n\r\n<div *ngIf=\"user.length > 0; else empty\"><h2>Users</h2></div>\r\n<ng-template #empty><h2>No users.</h2></ng-template>\r\n\r\n7. AS keyword â€“ A new addition to the template syntax is the â€œas keywordâ€? is use to simplify to the â€œletâ€? syntax.\r\n\r\nUse of as keyword,\r\n<div *ngFor=\"let user of users | slice:0:2 as total; index as = i\">\r\n    {{i+1}}/{{total.length}}: {{user.name}}\r\n</div>\r\n\r\nTo subscribe only once to a pipe â€œ|â€? with â€œasyncâ€? and If a user is an observable, you can now use to write,\r\n\r\n<div *ngIf=\"users | async as usersModel\">\r\n    <h2>{{ usersModel.name }}</h2> <small>{{ usersModel.age }}</small>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n8. Pipes - Angular 4 introduced a new â€œtitlecaseâ€? pipe â€œ|â€? and use to changes the first letter of each word into the uppercase. \r\n\r\nThe example as,\r\n<h2>{{ \'anil singh\' | titlecase }}</h2>\r\n<!-- OUPPUT - It will display \'Anil Singh\' -->\r\n\r\n9. Http - Adding search parameters to an â€œHTTP requestâ€? has been simplified as,\r\n\r\n//Angular 4 -\r\nhttp.get(`NULL/api/users`, { params: { sort: \'ascending\' } });\r\n\r\n//Angular 2-\r\nconst params = new URLSearchParams();\r\nparams.append(\'sort\', \'ascending\');\r\nhttp.get(`NULL/api/users`, { search: params });\r\n\r\n10. Test- Angular 4, overriding a template in a test has also been simplified as,\r\n\r\n//Angular 4 -\r\nTestBed.overrideTemplate(UsersComponent, \'<h2>{{users.name}}</h2>\');\r\n\r\n//Angular 2 -\r\nTestBed.overrideComponent(UsersComponent, {\r\n    set: { template: \'<h2>{{users.name}}</h2>\' }\r\n});\r\n\r\n11. Service- A new service has been introduced to easily get or update â€œMeta Tagsâ€? i.e.\r\n@Component({\r\n    selector: \'users-app\',\r\n    template: `<h1>Users</h1>`\r\n})\r\nexport class UsersAppComponent {\r\n    constructor(meta: Meta) {\r\n        meta.addTag({ name: \'Blogger\', content: \'Anil Singh\' });\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\n12. Forms Validators - One new validator joins the existing â€œrequiredâ€?, â€œminLengthâ€?, â€œmaxLengthâ€? and â€œpatternâ€?. An email helps you validate that the input is a valid email.\r\n\r\n13. Compare Select Options - A new â€œcompareWithâ€? directive has been added and it used to help you compare options from a select.\r\n\r\n<select [compareWith]=\"byUId\" [(ngModel)]=\"selectedUsers\">\r\n    <option *ngFor=\"let user of users\" [ngValue]=\"user.UId\">{{user.name}}</option>\r\n</select>\r\n\r\n14. Router - A new interface â€œparamMapâ€? and â€œqueryParamMapâ€? has been added and it introduced to represent the parameters of a URL. \r\n\r\nconst uid = this.route.snapshot.paramMap.get(\'UId\');\r\nthis.userService.get(uid).subscribe(user => this.name = name);\r\n\r\n15. CanDeactivate - This â€œCanDeactivateâ€? interface now has an extra (optional) parameter and it is containing the next state.\r\n\r\n16. I18n - The internationalization is tiny improvement.\r\n\r\n//Angular 4-\r\n<div [ngPlural]=\"value\">\r\n    <ng-template ngPluralCase=\"0\">there is nothing</ng-template>\r\n    <ng-template ngPluralCase=\"1\">there is one</ng-template>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n//Angular 2-\r\n<div [ngPlural]=\"value\">\r\n    <ng-template ngPluralCase=\"=0\">there is nothing</ng-template>\r\n    <ng-template ngPluralCase=\"=1\">there is one</ng-template>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n',2),(NULL,7,'What Is the forRoot Method in Angular 4?','\r\nThe forRoot is a static method and itâ€™s very easy for developers to configure the modules and the best example is - RouterModule.forRoot.\r\n\r\nThe RouterModule also offers a forChild.

Enter the URL in your address bar for your browser navigations.\r\n2.     Click on your navigations links on the page and the browser navigates to a new page which you have entered in the navigations URL.\r\n3.     Click the browsers back and forward buttons. The browser navigates backward and forward through the history of pages.\r\n\r\nRouter Imports- Angular Router is an optional service that presents a particular component view for a given URL i.e.\r\nimport { RouterModule, Routes } from \'@angular/router\';\r\n\r\nRouter Configuration -\r\nconst appRoutes: Routes = [\r\n  { path: \'\', redirectTo: \'home\', pathMatch: \'full\' },\r\n  { path: \'registration\', component: RegistrationComponent},\r\n  { path: \'login\', component: LoginComponent},\r\n  { path: \'\'home/:id\',      component: HomeComponent, data: { title: \'Home\' }},\r\n  { path: \'users\',    component: UserListComponent, data: { title: \'User List\' }},\r\n  { path: \'dashboard\', component: DashboardComponent, data: { title: \'Dashboard\' }}\r\n  { path: \'**\', component: PageNotFoundComponent }\r\n];\r\n\r\n@NgModule({\r\n  imports: [\r\n    UniversalModule, // MUST BE FIRST IMPORT.

You can access the current Router-State from anywhere in the application using the Router service and the router-State property.\r\n\r\nEach Activated-Route in the Router-State provides methods to traverse up and down the route tree to get information from parent, child and sibling routes.\r\n\r\nRouter Events -\r\n1.     NavigationStart- This event is triggered when navigation starts.\r\n2.     RoutesRecognized - This event is triggered when Router parses the URL and routes are recognized.\r\n3.     RouteConfigLoadStart- This event is triggered before the Router lazy loads a route configuration.\r\n4.     RouteConfigLoadEnd - This event is triggered after a route has been lazy loaded.\r\n5.     NavigationEnd - This event is triggered when navigation ends successfully!\r\n6.     NavigationCancel - This event is triggered when navigation is cancelled.\r\n7.

For instance, here is an example for our previously specified goal.\r\n\r\n\r\nconst routes: Routes  = [\r\n { path: \'\', redirectTo: \'login\', pathMatch:\'full\' },\r\n { path: \'login\', component: LoginComponent },\r\n { path: \'home\', component: HomeComponent ,\r\n  children: [\r\n   { path: \'\', component: DashBoardComponent },\r\n   {path: \'events\', component: EventsComponent}\r\n  ]},\r\n { path: \'register\', component: RegisterComponent },\r\n { path: \'about\', component: AboutComponent },\r\n { path: \'**\', component: p404Component },\r\n];\r\n1\r\n2\r\n3\r\n4\r\n5\r\n6\r\n7\r\n8\r\n9\r\n10\r\n11\r\n12\r\nconst routes: Routes  = [\r\n { path: \'\', redirectTo: \'login\', pathMatch:\'full\' },\r\n { path: \'login\', component: LoginComponent },\r\n { path: \'home\', component: HomeComponent ,\r\n  children: [\r\n   { path: \'\', component: DashBoardComponent },\r\n   {path: \'events\', component: EventsComponent}\r\n  ]},\r\n { path: \'register\', component: RegisterComponent },\r\n { path: \'about\', component: AboutComponent },\r\n { path: \'**\', component: p404Component },\r\n];\r\nWe have configure routes which is an array of Route. Each entry of the array is  The complete list of possible fields used in this configuration are as following:\r\n\r\npath Ã¢â‚¬â€œ url of the route used by the matcher DSL.\r\ncomponent Ã¢â‚¬â€œname of the target component.\r\npathMatch Ã¢â‚¬â€œ specifies the matching strategy, example : full.\r\nredirectTo -url that will replace the current matched segment in case of redirection.\r\noutlet Ã¢â‚¬â€œ name of the outlet used as a placeholder for the component. If there is no outlet it would be placed in <router-outlet>\r\ncanActivate Ã¢â‚¬â€œ array of DI tokens used to find CanActivate handlers.\r\ncanActivateChild Ã¢â‚¬â€œ array of DI tokens used to find CanActivateChild handlers.\r\ncanDeactivate Ã¢â‚¬â€œ array of DI tokens used to find CanDeactivate handlers.\r\ndata is additional data provided to the component via ActivatedRoute.\r\nresolve is a map of DI tokens used to look up data resolvers.\r\nchildren is an array used to define nested routes.\r\nRouter Directives\r\nAngular RouterModule has 3 different directives. Such as:\r\n\r\nrouter-outlet\r\nrouter-link\r\nrouterLinkActive\r\nrouter-outlet:\r\n\r\nrouter-outlet is a component from angular/router library. The router is the placeholder to display views inside  <router-outlet> tags. As the routes changes, the view inside the <router-outlet> tags also change accordingly.\r\n\r\n\r\n<div class=\"container-fluid\">\r\n        <router-outlet></router-outlet>\r\n</div>\r\n1\r\n2\r\n3\r\n<div class=\"container-fluid\">\r\n        <router-outlet></router-outlet>\r\n</div>\r\nrouter-link:\r\n\r\nrouter-link directive is an alternative of HTML href property. The syntax is as following:\r\n\r\n\r\n<a [routerLink]=\"[\'/url\']\">Url Title</a>\r\n1\r\n<a [routerLink]=\"[\'/url\']\">Url Title</a>\r\nrouter-link directive can also handle query parameter. For example, once we land in /hoem/events page, it shows a list of events , if we want to go to directly one of the events page, we can just put the iid of that specific event and can land of the event details page for event 01. For this purpose, we use [queryParams] binding. [queryParams] takes an object such as {Ã¢â‚¬ËœidÃ¢â‚¬â„¢:01} and can\r\n\r\nFirstly, We have bound router-link directive to events array as following:\r\n\r\n\r\n<a [routerLink]=\"[\'/home/events]\">Events</a>\r\n1\r\n<a [routerLink]=\"[\'/home/events]\">Events</a>\r\nNow inside app.router.ts we have configure the queryParams binding as following:\r\n\r\n\r\nthis.router.navigate([\'/home/events\', event.id]);\r\n1\r\nthis.router.navigate([\'/home/events\', event.id]);\r\nOtherwise, if we want to pass the queryParams in an object , we can also do that as following:\r\n\r\n\r\n<a [routerLink]=\"[\'/home/events, { id: \'event01\' }]\">Event 01 </a>\r\n\r\n<a [routerLink]=\"[\'/home/events, { id: \'event01\' }]\">Event 01 </a>\r\nOR\r\n\r\n\r\n<a [routerLink]=\"[\'/home/events, 1]\">Event 1</a>\r\n\r\n<a [routerLink]=\"[\'/home/events, 1]\">Event 1</a>\r\n\r\nrouterLinkActive:\r\n\r\nThe RouterLinkActive directive toggles css classes for active RouterLinks based on the current RouterState. This cascades down through each level in our route tree, so parent and child router links can be active at the same time. To override this behavior, we can bind to the [routerLinkActiveOptions] input binding with the { exact: true } expression. By using { exact: true }, a given RouterLink will only be active if its URL is an exact match to the current URL.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n',1),(NULL,7,'Metadata in Angularjs 2:','In Angular2.0, different decorators are used to pass variables to class.

You can see the below examples for set http headers request with and without HTTP interceptors.\r\n\r\nWhat Is the Use of Interceptors in Angular 4?\r\nThe Interceptors is a common used to set default headers for all responses.\r\n\r\nExample 1 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ  For Angular 4\r\n\r\nSet Headers Http Request Using Http Interceptors -\r\nThe HTTP Interceptors are now available via using the new HttpClient from angular/common/http in the Angular 4.x versions.\r\n\r\nSteps 1 - Writing an interceptor for adds a header for every request!\r\nimport {HttpEvent, HttpInterceptor, HttpHandler, HttpRequest} from \'@angular/common/http\';\r\n\r\nexport class AddHttpHeaderInterceptor implements HttpInterceptor {\r\n  intercept(req: HttpRequest<any>, next: HttpHandler): Observable<HttpEvent<any>> {\r\n    // Get the auth header from the service.\r\n    const authHeader = \'token_value\';\r\n    const clonedReq = req.clone({headers: req.headers.set(\'Authorization\', authHeader)});\r\n\r\n    return next.handle(clonedReq);\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\nSteps 2 - Providing your interceptor!\r\n- After creating the interceptor, we need to register it using the HTTP_INTERCEPTORS in the @NgModule()\r\n\r\nimport { HTTP_INTERCEPTORS } from \'@angular/common/http\';\r\n\r\n@NgModule({\r\n  providers: [{\r\n    provide: HTTP_INTERCEPTORS,\r\n    useClass: AddHttpHeaderInterceptor,\r\n    multi: true,\r\n  }],\r\n})\r\n\r\nexport class AppModule {}\r\n\r\nExample 2-  For Angular 2\r\n\r\nSet Headers Http Request without HTTP Interceptors  -\r\n\r\nSteps 1 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ We are creating the HttpClient Injectable class.\r\nimport {Injectable} from \'@angular/core\';\r\nimport {Http, Headers} from \'@angular/http\';\r\n\r\n@Injectable()\r\nexport class HttpClient {\r\n  constructor(private http: Http) {}\r\n\r\n  createAuthHeader(headers: Headers) {\r\n    headers.append(\'Content-Type\', \'application/json\');\r\n    headers.append(\'Authorization\', \'Basic \' + btoa(\'user-name:password\')); \r\n  }\r\n\r\n  get(url) {\r\n    let headers = new Headers();\r\n    this.createAuthHeader(headers);\r\n\r\n    return this.http.get(url, {headers: headers});\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  post(url, data) {\r\n    let headers = new Headers();\r\n    this.createAuthHeader(headers);\r\n\r\n    return this.http.post(url, data, {headers: headers});\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  put(url, data) {\r\n    let headers = new Headers();\r\n    this.createAuthHeader(headers);\r\n\r\n    return this.http.put(url, data, {headers: headers});\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\nSteps 2 - Injecting the HttpClient object in the Component\r\nimport { HttpClient } from \'../http-client\';\r\n\r\nexport class userComponent {\r\n  constructor(http: HttpClient) {\r\n    this.http = httpClient;\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  getUsers() {\r\n    this.http.get(url).subscribe(data =>{console.log(data); });\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  addUsers(user) {\r\n    this.http.post(url, user).subscribe(data =>{console.log(data); });\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n',2),(NULL,7,'WhatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s New in Angular 4? AND what are the Improvements in Angular 4?','Angular 4 contains some additional Enhancement and Improvement. Consider the following enhancements.\r\n\r\n1.    Smaller & Faster Apps\r\n2.    View Engine Size Reduce\r\n3.    Animation Package\r\n4.    NgIf and ngFor Improvement\r\n5.    Template\r\n6.    NgIf with Else\r\n7.    Use of AS keyword\r\n8.    Pipes\r\n9.    HTTP Request Simplified\r\n10. Apps Testing Simplified\r\n11. Introduce Meta Tags\r\n12. Added some Forms Validators Attributes\r\n13. Added Compare Select Options\r\n14. Enhancement in Router\r\n15. Added Optional Parameter\r\n16. Improvement Internationalization\r\n\r\n1. Smaller & Faster Apps - Angular 4 applications is smaller & faster in comparison with Angular 2.\r\n\r\n2. View Engine Size Reduce - Some changes under to hood to what AOT generated code compilation that means in Angular 4, improved the compilation time. These changes reduce around 60% size in most cases.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3. Animation Package- Animations now have their own package i.e. @angular/platform-browser/animations\r\n\r\n4. Improvement - Some Improvement on *ngIf and *ngFor.\r\n\r\nStayed Informed Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Angular 2 vs. Angular 1\r\n\r\n5. Template - The template is now ng-template. You should use the Ã¢â‚¬Å“ng-templateÃ¢â‚¬? tag instead of Ã¢â‚¬Å“templateÃ¢â‚¬?. Now Angular has its own template tag that is called Ã¢â‚¬Å“ng-templateÃ¢â‚¬?.\r\n\r\n6. NgIf with Else Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Now in Angular 4, possible to use an else syntax as,\r\n\r\n<div *ngIf=\"user.length > 0; else empty\"><h2>Users</h2></div>\r\n<ng-template #empty><h2>No users.</h2></ng-template>\r\n\r\n7. AS keyword Ã¢â‚¬â€œ A new addition to the template syntax is the Ã¢â‚¬Å“as keywordÃ¢â‚¬? is use to simplify to the Ã¢â‚¬Å“letÃ¢â‚¬? syntax.\r\n\r\nUse of as keyword,\r\n<div *ngFor=\"let user of users | slice:0:2 as total; index as = i\">\r\n    {{i+1}}/{{total.length}}: {{user.name}}\r\n</div>\r\n\r\nTo subscribe only once to a pipe Ã¢â‚¬Å“|Ã¢â‚¬? with Ã¢â‚¬Å“asyncÃ¢â‚¬? and If a user is an observable, you can now use to write,\r\n\r\n<div *ngIf=\"users | async as usersModel\">\r\n    <h2>{{ usersModel.name }}</h2> <small>{{ usersModel.age }}</small>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n8. Pipes - Angular 4 introduced a new Ã¢â‚¬Å“titlecaseÃ¢â‚¬? pipe Ã¢â‚¬Å“|Ã¢â‚¬? and use to changes the first letter of each word into the uppercase. \r\n\r\nThe example as,\r\n<h2>{{ \'anil singh\' | titlecase }}</h2>\r\n<!-- OUPPUT - It will display \'Anil Singh\' -->\r\n\r\n9. Http - Adding search parameters to an Ã¢â‚¬Å“HTTP requestÃ¢â‚¬? has been simplified as,\r\n\r\n//Angular 4 -\r\nhttp.get(`NULL/api/users`, { params: { sort: \'ascending\' } });\r\n\r\n//Angular 2-\r\nconst params = new URLSearchParams();\r\nparams.append(\'sort\', \'ascending\');\r\nhttp.get(`NULL/api/users`, { search: params });\r\n\r\n10. Test- Angular 4, overriding a template in a test has also been simplified as,\r\n\r\n//Angular 4 -\r\nTestBed.overrideTemplate(UsersComponent, \'<h2>{{users.name}}</h2>\');\r\n\r\n//Angular 2 -\r\nTestBed.overrideComponent(UsersComponent, {\r\n    set: { template: \'<h2>{{users.name}}</h2>\' }\r\n});\r\n\r\n11. Service- A new service has been introduced to easily get or update Ã¢â‚¬Å“Meta TagsÃ¢â‚¬? i.e.\r\n@Component({\r\n    selector: \'users-app\',\r\n    template: `<h1>Users</h1>`\r\n})\r\nexport class UsersAppComponent {\r\n    constructor(meta: Meta) {\r\n        meta.addTag({ name: \'Blogger\', content: \'Anil Singh\' });\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\n12. Forms Validators - One new validator joins the existing Ã¢â‚¬Å“requiredÃ¢â‚¬?, Ã¢â‚¬Å“minLengthÃ¢â‚¬?, Ã¢â‚¬Å“maxLengthÃ¢â‚¬? and Ã¢â‚¬Å“patternÃ¢â‚¬?. An email helps you validate that the input is a valid email.\r\n\r\n13. Compare Select Options - A new Ã¢â‚¬Å“compareWithÃ¢â‚¬? directive has been added and it used to help you compare options from a select.\r\n\r\n<select [compareWith]=\"byUId\" [(ngModel)]=\"selectedUsers\">\r\n    <option *ngFor=\"let user of users\" [ngValue]=\"user.UId\">{{user.name}}</option>\r\n</select>\r\n\r\n14. Router - A new interface Ã¢â‚¬Å“paramMapÃ¢â‚¬? and Ã¢â‚¬Å“queryParamMapÃ¢â‚¬? has been added and it introduced to represent the parameters of a URL. \r\n\r\nconst uid = this.route.snapshot.paramMap.get(\'UId\');\r\nthis.userService.get(uid).subscribe(user => this.name = name);\r\n\r\n15. CanDeactivate - This Ã¢â‚¬Å“CanDeactivateÃ¢â‚¬? interface now has an extra (optional) parameter and it is containing the next state.\r\n\r\n16. I18n - The internationalization is tiny improvement.\r\n\r\n//Angular 4-\r\n<div [ngPlural]=\"value\">\r\n    <ng-template ngPluralCase=\"0\">there is nothing</ng-template>\r\n    <ng-template ngPluralCase=\"1\">there is one</ng-template>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n//Angular 2-\r\n<div [ngPlural]=\"value\">\r\n    <ng-template ngPluralCase=\"=0\">there is nothing</ng-template>\r\n    <ng-template ngPluralCase=\"=1\">there is one</ng-template>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n',2),(NULL,7,'What Is the forRoot Method in Angular 4?','\r\nThe forRoot is a static method and itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s very easy for developers to configure the modules and the best example is - RouterModule.forRoot.\r\n\r\nThe RouterModule also offers a forChild. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s also a static method and use to configure the routes of lazy-loaded modules.

For instance, here is an example for our previously specified goal.\r\n\r\n\r\nconst routes: Routes  = [\r\n { path: \'\', redirectTo: \'login\', pathMatch:\'full\' },\r\n { path: \'login\', component: LoginComponent },\r\n { path: \'home\', component: HomeComponent ,\r\n  children: [\r\n   { path: \'\', component: DashBoardComponent },\r\n   {path: \'events\', component: EventsComponent}\r\n  ]},\r\n { path: \'register\', component: RegisterComponent },\r\n { path: \'about\', component: AboutComponent },\r\n { path: \'**\', component: p404Component },\r\n];\r\n1\r\n2\r\n3\r\n4\r\n5\r\n6\r\n7\r\n8\r\n9\r\n10\r\n11\r\n12\r\nconst routes: Routes  = [\r\n { path: \'\', redirectTo: \'login\', pathMatch:\'full\' },\r\n { path: \'login\', component: LoginComponent },\r\n { path: \'home\', component: HomeComponent ,\r\n  children: [\r\n   { path: \'\', component: DashBoardComponent },\r\n   {path: \'events\', component: EventsComponent}\r\n  ]},\r\n { path: \'register\', component: RegisterComponent },\r\n { path: \'about\', component: AboutComponent },\r\n { path: \'**\', component: p404Component },\r\n];\r\nWe have configure routes which is an array of Route. Each entry of the array is  The complete list of possible fields used in this configuration are as following:\r\n\r\npath â€“ url of the route used by the matcher DSL.\r\ncomponent â€“name of the target component.\r\npathMatch â€“ specifies the matching strategy, example : full.\r\nredirectTo -url that will replace the current matched segment in case of redirection.\r\noutlet â€“ name of the outlet used as a placeholder for the component. If there is no outlet it would be placed in <router-outlet>\r\ncanActivate â€“ array of DI tokens used to find CanActivate handlers.\r\ncanActivateChild â€“ array of DI tokens used to find CanActivateChild handlers.\r\ncanDeactivate â€“ array of DI tokens used to find CanDeactivate handlers.\r\ndata is additional data provided to the component via ActivatedRoute.\r\nresolve is a map of DI tokens used to look up data resolvers.\r\nchildren is an array used to define nested routes.\r\nRouter Directives\r\nAngular RouterModule has 3 different directives. Such as:\r\n\r\nrouter-outlet\r\nrouter-link\r\nrouterLinkActive\r\nrouter-outlet:\r\n\r\nrouter-outlet is a component from angular/router library. The router is the placeholder to display views inside  <router-outlet> tags. As the routes changes, the view inside the <router-outlet> tags also change accordingly.\r\n\r\n\r\n<div class=\"container-fluid\">\r\n        <router-outlet></router-outlet>\r\n</div>\r\n1\r\n2\r\n3\r\n<div class=\"container-fluid\">\r\n        <router-outlet></router-outlet>\r\n</div>\r\nrouter-link:\r\n\r\nrouter-link directive is an alternative of HTML href property. The syntax is as following:\r\n\r\n\r\n<a [routerLink]=\"[\'/url\']\">Url Title</a>\r\n1\r\n<a [routerLink]=\"[\'/url\']\">Url Title</a>\r\nrouter-link directive can also handle query parameter. For example, once we land in /hoem/events page, it shows a list of events , if we want to go to directly one of the events page, we can just put the iid of that specific event and can land of the event details page for event 01. For this purpose, we use [queryParams] binding. [queryParams] takes an object such as {â€˜idâ€™:01} and can\r\n\r\nFirstly, We have bound router-link directive to events array as following:\r\n\r\n\r\n<a [routerLink]=\"[\'/home/events]\">Events</a>\r\n1\r\n<a [routerLink]=\"[\'/home/events]\">Events</a>\r\nNow inside app.router.ts we have configure the queryParams binding as following:\r\n\r\n\r\nthis.router.navigate([\'/home/events\', event.id]);\r\n1\r\nthis.router.navigate([\'/home/events\', event.id]);\r\nOtherwise, if we want to pass the queryParams in an object , we can also do that as following:\r\n\r\n\r\n<a [routerLink]=\"[\'/home/events, { id: \'event01\' }]\">Event 01 </a>\r\n\r\n<a [routerLink]=\"[\'/home/events, { id: \'event01\' }]\">Event 01 </a>\r\nOR\r\n\r\n\r\n<a [routerLink]=\"[\'/home/events, 1]\">Event 1</a>\r\n\r\n<a [routerLink]=\"[\'/home/events, 1]\">Event 1</a>\r\n\r\nrouterLinkActive:\r\n\r\nThe RouterLinkActive directive toggles css classes for active RouterLinks based on the current RouterState. This cascades down through each level in our route tree, so parent and child router links can be active at the same time. To override this behavior, we can bind to the [routerLinkActiveOptions] input binding with the { exact: true } expression. By using { exact: true }, a given RouterLink will only be active if its URL is an exact match to the current URL.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n',1),(NULL,7,'Metadata in Angularjs 2:','In Angular2.0, different decorators are used to pass variables to class.

You can see the below examples for set http headers request with and without HTTP interceptors.\r\n\r\nWhat Is the Use of Interceptors in Angular 4?\r\nThe Interceptors is a common used to set default headers for all responses.\r\n\r\nExample 1 â€“  For Angular 4\r\n\r\nSet Headers Http Request Using Http Interceptors -\r\nThe HTTP Interceptors are now available via using the new HttpClient from angular/common/http in the Angular 4.x versions.\r\n\r\nSteps 1 - Writing an interceptor for adds a header for every request!\r\nimport {HttpEvent, HttpInterceptor, HttpHandler, HttpRequest} from \'@angular/common/http\';\r\n\r\nexport class AddHttpHeaderInterceptor implements HttpInterceptor {\r\n  intercept(req: HttpRequest<any>, next: HttpHandler): Observable<HttpEvent<any>> {\r\n    // Get the auth header from the service.\r\n    const authHeader = \'token_value\';\r\n    const clonedReq = req.clone({headers: req.headers.set(\'Authorization\', authHeader)});\r\n\r\n    return next.handle(clonedReq);\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\nSteps 2 - Providing your interceptor!\r\n- After creating the interceptor, we need to register it using the HTTP_INTERCEPTORS in the @NgModule()\r\n\r\nimport { HTTP_INTERCEPTORS } from \'@angular/common/http\';\r\n\r\n@NgModule({\r\n  providers: [{\r\n    provide: HTTP_INTERCEPTORS,\r\n    useClass: AddHttpHeaderInterceptor,\r\n    multi: true,\r\n  }],\r\n})\r\n\r\nexport class AppModule {}\r\n\r\nExample 2-  For Angular 2\r\n\r\nSet Headers Http Request without HTTP Interceptors  -\r\n\r\nSteps 1 â€“ We are creating the HttpClient Injectable class.\r\nimport {Injectable} from \'@angular/core\';\r\nimport {Http, Headers} from \'@angular/http\';\r\n\r\n@Injectable()\r\nexport class HttpClient {\r\n  constructor(private http: Http) {}\r\n\r\n  createAuthHeader(headers: Headers) {\r\n    headers.append(\'Content-Type\', \'application/json\');\r\n    headers.append(\'Authorization\', \'Basic \' + btoa(\'user-name:password\')); \r\n  }\r\n\r\n  get(url) {\r\n    let headers = new Headers();\r\n    this.createAuthHeader(headers);\r\n\r\n    return this.http.get(url, {headers: headers});\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  post(url, data) {\r\n    let headers = new Headers();\r\n    this.createAuthHeader(headers);\r\n\r\n    return this.http.post(url, data, {headers: headers});\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  put(url, data) {\r\n    let headers = new Headers();\r\n    this.createAuthHeader(headers);\r\n\r\n    return this.http.put(url, data, {headers: headers});\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\nSteps 2 - Injecting the HttpClient object in the Component\r\nimport { HttpClient } from \'../http-client\';\r\n\r\nexport class userComponent {\r\n  constructor(http: HttpClient) {\r\n    this.http = httpClient;\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  getUsers() {\r\n    this.http.get(url).subscribe(data =>{console.log(data); });\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  addUsers(user) {\r\n    this.http.post(url, user).subscribe(data =>{console.log(data); });\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n',2),(NULL,7,'Whatâ€™s New in Angular 4? AND what are the Improvements in Angular 4?','Angular 4 contains some additional Enhancement and Improvement. Consider the following enhancements.\r\n\r\n1.    Smaller & Faster Apps\r\n2.    View Engine Size Reduce\r\n3.    Animation Package\r\n4.    NgIf and ngFor Improvement\r\n5.    Template\r\n6.    NgIf with Else\r\n7.    Use of AS keyword\r\n8.    Pipes\r\n9.    HTTP Request Simplified\r\n10. Apps Testing Simplified\r\n11. Introduce Meta Tags\r\n12. Added some Forms Validators Attributes\r\n13. Added Compare Select Options\r\n14. Enhancement in Router\r\n15. Added Optional Parameter\r\n16. Improvement Internationalization\r\n\r\n1. Smaller & Faster Apps - Angular 4 applications is smaller & faster in comparison with Angular 2.\r\n\r\n2. View Engine Size Reduce - Some changes under to hood to what AOT generated code compilation that means in Angular 4, improved the compilation time. These changes reduce around 60% size in most cases.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3. Animation Package- Animations now have their own package i.e. @angular/platform-browser/animations\r\n\r\n4. Improvement - Some Improvement on *ngIf and *ngFor.\r\n\r\nStayed Informed â€“ Angular 2 vs. Angular 1\r\n\r\n5. Template - The template is now ng-template. You should use the â€œng-templateâ€? tag instead of â€œtemplateâ€?. Now Angular has its own template tag that is called â€œng-templateâ€?.\r\n\r\n6. NgIf with Else â€“ Now in Angular 4, possible to use an else syntax as,\r\n\r\n<div *ngIf=\"user.length > 0; else empty\"><h2>Users</h2></div>\r\n<ng-template #empty><h2>No users.</h2></ng-template>\r\n\r\n7. AS keyword â€“ A new addition to the template syntax is the â€œas keywordâ€? is use to simplify to the â€œletâ€? syntax.\r\n\r\nUse of as keyword,\r\n<div *ngFor=\"let user of users | slice:0:2 as total; index as = i\">\r\n    {{i+1}}/{{total.length}}: {{user.name}}\r\n</div>\r\n\r\nTo subscribe only once to a pipe â€œ|â€? with â€œasyncâ€? and If a user is an observable, you can now use to write,\r\n\r\n<div *ngIf=\"users | async as usersModel\">\r\n    <h2>{{ usersModel.name }}</h2> <small>{{ usersModel.age }}</small>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n8. Pipes - Angular 4 introduced a new â€œtitlecaseâ€? pipe â€œ|â€? and use to changes the first letter of each word into the uppercase. \r\n\r\nThe example as,\r\n<h2>{{ \'anil singh\' | titlecase }}</h2>\r\n<!-- OUPPUT - It will display \'Anil Singh\' -->\r\n\r\n9. Http - Adding search parameters to an â€œHTTP requestâ€? has been simplified as,\r\n\r\n//Angular 4 -\r\nhttp.get(`NULL/api/users`, { params: { sort: \'ascending\' } });\r\n\r\n//Angular 2-\r\nconst params = new URLSearchParams();\r\nparams.append(\'sort\', \'ascending\');\r\nhttp.get(`NULL/api/users`, { search: params });\r\n\r\n10. Test- Angular 4, overriding a template in a test has also been simplified as,\r\n\r\n//Angular 4 -\r\nTestBed.overrideTemplate(UsersComponent, \'<h2>{{users.name}}</h2>\');\r\n\r\n//Angular 2 -\r\nTestBed.overrideComponent(UsersComponent, {\r\n    set: { template: \'<h2>{{users.name}}</h2>\' }\r\n});\r\n\r\n11. Service- A new service has been introduced to easily get or update â€œMeta Tagsâ€? i.e.\r\n@Component({\r\n    selector: \'users-app\',\r\n    template: `<h1>Users</h1>`\r\n})\r\nexport class UsersAppComponent {\r\n    constructor(meta: Meta) {\r\n        meta.addTag({ name: \'Blogger\', content: \'Anil Singh\' });\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\n12. Forms Validators - One new validator joins the existing â€œrequiredâ€?, â€œminLengthâ€?, â€œmaxLengthâ€? and â€œpatternâ€?. An email helps you validate that the input is a valid email.\r\n\r\n13. Compare Select Options - A new â€œcompareWithâ€? directive has been added and it used to help you compare options from a select.\r\n\r\n<select [compareWith]=\"byUId\" [(ngModel)]=\"selectedUsers\">\r\n    <option *ngFor=\"let user of users\" [ngValue]=\"user.UId\">{{user.name}}</option>\r\n</select>\r\n\r\n14. Router - A new interface â€œparamMapâ€? and â€œqueryParamMapâ€? has been added and it introduced to represent the parameters of a URL. \r\n\r\nconst uid = this.route.snapshot.paramMap.get(\'UId\');\r\nthis.userService.get(uid).subscribe(user => this.name = name);\r\n\r\n15. CanDeactivate - This â€œCanDeactivateâ€? interface now has an extra (optional) parameter and it is containing the next state.\r\n\r\n16. I18n - The internationalization is tiny improvement.\r\n\r\n//Angular 4-\r\n<div [ngPlural]=\"value\">\r\n    <ng-template ngPluralCase=\"0\">there is nothing</ng-template>\r\n    <ng-template ngPluralCase=\"1\">there is one</ng-template>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n//Angular 2-\r\n<div [ngPlural]=\"value\">\r\n    <ng-template ngPluralCase=\"=0\">there is nothing</ng-template>\r\n    <ng-template ngPluralCase=\"=1\">there is one</ng-template>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n',2),(NULL,7,'What Is the forRoot Method in Angular 4?','\r\nThe forRoot is a static method and itâ€™s very easy for developers to configure the modules and the best example is - RouterModule.forRoot.\r\n\r\nThe RouterModule also offers a forChild.

Enter the URL in your address bar for your browser navigations.\r\n2.     Click on your navigations links on the page and the browser navigates to a new page which you have entered in the navigations URL.\r\n3.     Click the browsers back and forward buttons. The browser navigates backward and forward through the history of pages.\r\n\r\nRouter Imports- Angular Router is an optional service that presents a particular component view for a given URL i.e.\r\nimport { RouterModule, Routes } from \'@angular/router\';\r\n\r\nRouter Configuration -\r\nconst appRoutes: Routes = [\r\n  { path: \'\', redirectTo: \'home\', pathMatch: \'full\' },\r\n  { path: \'registration\', component: RegistrationComponent},\r\n  { path: \'login\', component: LoginComponent},\r\n  { path: \'\'home/:id\',      component: HomeComponent, data: { title: \'Home\' }},\r\n  { path: \'users\',    component: UserListComponent, data: { title: \'User List\' }},\r\n  { path: \'dashboard\', component: DashboardComponent, data: { title: \'Dashboard\' }}\r\n  { path: \'**\', component: PageNotFoundComponent }\r\n];\r\n\r\n@NgModule({\r\n  imports: [\r\n    UniversalModule, // MUST BE FIRST IMPORT.

You can access the current Router-State from anywhere in the application using the Router service and the router-State property.\r\n\r\nEach Activated-Route in the Router-State provides methods to traverse up and down the route tree to get information from parent, child and sibling routes.\r\n\r\nRouter Events -\r\n1.     NavigationStart- This event is triggered when navigation starts.\r\n2.     RoutesRecognized - This event is triggered when Router parses the URL and routes are recognized.\r\n3.     RouteConfigLoadStart- This event is triggered before the Router lazy loads a route configuration.\r\n4.     RouteConfigLoadEnd - This event is triggered after a route has been lazy loaded.\r\n5.     NavigationEnd - This event is triggered when navigation ends successfully!\r\n6.     NavigationCancel - This event is triggered when navigation is cancelled.\r\n7.

Property binding in angular can take place by three ways:\r\n\r\nInterpolation can be used to define a value, as long as the value being defined is a string.\r\n\r\nWrapping brackets around the element property and binding it to the component property is the most common type of property binding.\r\nThe third way is by adding â€œbindâ€? before the element property.\r\n\r\n\r\n',2),(NULL,7,'Explain ngIf directive with an example.','The ngIf is a built-in template directive which is used to add or remove some parts of DOM.

Such as:\n\nrouter-outlet\nrouter-link\nrouterLinkActive\nrouter-outlet:\n\nrouter-outlet is a component from angular/router library. The router is the placeholder to display views inside  <router-outlet> tags. As the routes changes, the view inside the <router-outlet> tags also change accordingly.\n\n\n<div class=\"container-fluid\">\n        <router-outlet></router-outlet>\n</div>\n1\n2\n3\n<div class=\"container-fluid\">\n        <router-outlet></router-outlet>\n</div>\nrouter-link:\n\nrouter-link directive is an alternative of HTML href property. The syntax is as following:\n\n\n<a [routerLink]=\"[\'/url\']\">Url Title</a>\n1\n<a [routerLink]=\"[\'/url\']\">Url Title</a>\nrouter-link directive can also handle query parameter. For example, once we land in /hoem/events page, it shows a list of events , if we want to go to directly one of the events page, we can just put the iid of that specific event and can land of the event details page for event 01. For this purpose, we use [queryParams] binding. [queryParams] takes an object such as {â€˜idâ€™:01} and can\n\nFirstly, We have bound router-link directive to events array as following:\n\n\n<a [routerLink]=\"[\'/home/events]\">Events</a>\n1\n<a [routerLink]=\"[\'/home/events]\">Events</a>\nNow inside app.router.ts we have configure the queryParams binding as following:\n\n\nthis.router.navigate([\'/home/events\', event.id]);\n1\nthis.router.navigate([\'/home/events\', event.id]);\nOtherwise, if we want to pass the queryParams in an object , we can also do that as following:\n\n\n<a [routerLink]=\"[\'/home/events, { id: \'event01\' }]\">Event 01 </a>\n\n<a [routerLink]=\"[\'/home/events, { id: \'event01\' }]\">Event 01 </a>\nOR\n\n\n<a [routerLink]=\"[\'/home/events, 1]\">Event 1</a>\n\n<a [routerLink]=\"[\'/home/events, 1]\">Event 1</a>\n\nrouterLinkActive:\n\nThe RouterLinkActive directive toggles css classes for active RouterLinks based on the current RouterState. This cascades down through each level in our route tree, so parent and child router links can be active at the same time. To override this behavior, we can bind to the [routerLinkActiveOptions] input binding with the { exact: true } expression. By using { exact: true }, a given RouterLink will only be active if its URL is an exact match to the current URL.\n\n\n\n',1),(712,7,'Metadata in Angularjs 2:','In Angular2.0, different decorators are used to pass variables to class.

Apps Testing Simplified\n11. Introduce Meta Tags\n12. Added some Forms Validators Attributes\n13. Added Compare Select Options\n14. Enhancement in Router\n15. Added Optional Parameter\n16. Improvement Internationalization\n\n1. Smaller & Faster Apps - Angular 4 applications is smaller & faster in comparison with Angular 2.\n\n2. View Engine Size Reduce - Some changes under to hood to what AOT generated code compilation that means in Angular 4, improved the compilation time. These changes reduce around 60% size in most cases.\n\n\n\n3. Animation Package- Animations now have their own package i.e. @angular/platform-browser/animations\n\n4. Improvement - Some Improvement on *ngIf and *ngFor.\n\nStayed Informed â€“ Angular 2 vs. Angular 1\n\n5. Template - The template is now ng-template. You should use the â€œng-templateâ€? tag instead of â€œtemplateâ€?. Now Angular has its own template tag that is called â€œng-templateâ€?.\n\n6. NgIf with Else â€“ Now in Angular 4, possible to use an else syntax as,\n\n<div *ngIf=\"user.length > 0; else empty\"><h2>Users</h2></div>\n<ng-template #empty><h2>No users.</h2></ng-template>\n\n7. AS keyword â€“ A new addition to the template syntax is the â€œas keywordâ€? is use to simplify to the â€œletâ€? syntax.\n\nUse of as keyword,\n<div *ngFor=\"let user of users | slice:0:2 as total; index as = i\">\n    {{i+1}}/{{total.length}}: {{user.name}}\n</div>\n\nTo subscribe only once to a pipe â€œ|â€? with â€œasyncâ€? and If a user is an observable, you can now use to write,\n\n<div *ngIf=\"users | async as usersModel\">\n    <h2>{{ usersModel.name }}</h2> <small>{{ usersModel.age }}</small>\n</div>\n\n\n8. Pipes - Angular 4 introduced a new â€œtitlecaseâ€? pipe â€œ|â€? and use to changes the first letter of each word into the uppercase. \n\nThe example as,\n<h2>{{ \'anil singh\' | titlecase }}</h2>\n<!-- OUPPUT - It will display \'Anil Singh\' -->\n\n9. Http - Adding search parameters to an â€œHTTP requestâ€? has been simplified as,\n\n//Angular 4 -\nhttp.get(`NULL/api/users`, { params: { sort: \'ascending\' } });\n\n//Angular 2-\nconst params = new URLSearchParams();\nparams.append(\'sort\', \'ascending\');\nhttp.get(`NULL/api/users`, { search: params });\n\n10. Test- Angular 4, overriding a template in a test has also been simplified as,\n\n//Angular 4 -\nTestBed.overrideTemplate(UsersComponent, \'<h2>{{users.name}}</h2>\');\n\n//Angular 2 -\nTestBed.overrideComponent(UsersComponent, {\n    set: { template: \'<h2>{{users.name}}</h2>\' }\n});\n\n11. Service- A new service has been introduced to easily get or update â€œMeta Tagsâ€? i.e.\n@Component({\n    selector: \'users-app\',\n    template: `<h1>Users</h1>`\n})\nexport class UsersAppComponent {\n    constructor(meta: Meta) {\n        meta.addTag({ name: \'Blogger\', content: \'Anil Singh\' });\n    }\n}\n\n12. Forms Validators - One new validator joins the existing â€œrequiredâ€?, â€œminLengthâ€?, â€œmaxLengthâ€? and â€œpatternâ€?. An email helps you validate that the input is a valid email.\n\n13. Compare Select Options - A new â€œcompareWithâ€? directive has been added and it used to help you compare options from a select.\n\n<select [compareWith]=\"byUId\" [(ngModel)]=\"selectedUsers\">\n    <option *ngFor=\"let user of users\" [ngValue]=\"user.UId\">{{user.name}}</option>\n</select>\n\n14. Router - A new interface â€œparamMapâ€? and â€œqueryParamMapâ€? has been added and it introduced to represent the parameters of a URL. \n\nconst uid = this.route.snapshot.paramMap.get(\'UId\');\nthis.userService.get(uid).subscribe(user => this.name = name);\n\n15. CanDeactivate - This â€œCanDeactivateâ€? interface now has an extra (optional) parameter and it is containing the next state.\n\n16. I18n - The internationalization is tiny improvement.\n\n//Angular 4-\n<div [ngPlural]=\"value\">\n    <ng-template ngPluralCase=\"0\">there is nothing</ng-template>\n    <ng-template ngPluralCase=\"1\">there is one</ng-template>\n</div>\n\n//Angular 2-\n<div [ngPlural]=\"value\">\n    <ng-template ngPluralCase=\"=0\">there is nothing</ng-template>\n    <ng-template ngPluralCase=\"=1\">there is one</ng-template>\n</div>\n\n\n\n',2),(717,7,'Angular 4 Setup Guide for Development Environment!','Angular 4 Setup Guide  -\n\nStep 1.

Router Outlet\n4.     Router Link\n5.     Router State\n6.     Router Events\n\nAngular Routing Overview -\n1.     Enter the URL in your address bar for your browser navigations.\n2.     Click on your navigations links on the page and the browser navigates to a new page which you have entered in the navigations URL.\n3.     Click the browsers back and forward buttons. The browser navigates backward and forward through the history of pages.\n\nRouter Imports- Angular Router is an optional service that presents a particular component view for a given URL i.e.\nimport { RouterModule, Routes } from \'@angular/router\';\n\nRouter Configuration -\nconst appRoutes: Routes = [\n  { path: \'\', redirectTo: \'home\', pathMatch: \'full\' },\n  { path: \'registration\', component: RegistrationComponent},\n  { path: \'login\', component: LoginComponent},\n  { path: \'\'home/:id\',      component: HomeComponent, data: { title: \'Home\' }},\n  { path: \'users\',    component: UserListComponent, data: { title: \'User List\' }},\n  { path: \'dashboard\', component: DashboardComponent, data: { title: \'Dashboard\' }}\n  { path: \'**\', component: PageNotFoundComponent }\n];\n\n@NgModule({\n  imports: [\n    UniversalModule, // MUST BE FIRST IMPORT.

Both the template and templateUrl render the components where you use this directive.\n\nSyntax â€“\n<router-outlet></router-outlet>\n\nExample -\n<div class=\'container\'>   \n    <div class=\'row\'>\n        <router-outlet></router-outlet>\n    </div>\n</div>\n\nRouter Link - It is use to link to application\'s routes and Router-link directive is used to link a specific part of your applications.\n\nSyntax â€“ \n<router-link></router-link>\n\nExample â€“\n<ul class=\'nav navbar-nav\'>\n    <li [routerLinkActive]=\"[\'link-active\']\">\n        <a [routerLink]=\"[\'/login\']\">\n            <span class=\'glyphicon glyphicon-Login\'></span> Login\n        </a>\n    </li>\n    <li [routerLinkActive]=\"[\'link-active\']\">\n        <a [routerLink]=\"[\'/registration\']\">\n            <span class=\'glyphicon glyphicon-Register\'></span> Register\n        </a>\n    </li>\n    <li [routerLinkActive]=\"[\'link-active\']\">\n        <a [routerLink]=\"[\'/Users\']\">\n            <span class=\'glyphicon glyphicon-Users\'></span> Users\n        </a>\n    </li>\n    <li [routerLinkActive]=\"[\'link-active\']\">\n        <a [routerLink]=\"[\'/Dashboard\']\">\n            <span class=\'glyphicon glyphicon-Dashboard\'></span> Dashboard\n        </a>\n    </li>\n</ul>\n\nRouter State -\nAfter the end of each successful navigation life-cycle, the router builds a tree of Activated-Route objects that make up the current state of the router. You can access the current Router-State from anywhere in the application using the Router service and the router-State property.\n\nEach Activated-Route in the Router-State provides methods to traverse up and down the route tree to get information from parent, child and sibling routes.\n\nRouter Events -\n1.     NavigationStart- This event is triggered when navigation starts.\n2.     RoutesRecognized - This event is triggered when Router parses the URL and routes are recognized.\n3.     RouteConfigLoadStart- This event is triggered before the Router lazy loads a route configuration.\n4.     RouteConfigLoadEnd - This event is triggered after a route has been lazy loaded.\n5.     NavigationEnd - This event is triggered when navigation ends successfully!\n6.     NavigationCancel - This event is triggered when navigation is cancelled.\n7.     NavigationError - This event is triggered when navigation fails due to error.\n\n\n\n\n',2),(733,7,'Angular 4 Error Handling - Logging, Retry Request and HttpCache!','\nWhat Happens If the Request fails on the Server Due to Poor Network Connection?\nHttpClient will return an error instead of a successful response.\n\nExample - Add an error handler to handle the errors\nhttp.get(\'/api/users\')\n  .subscribe(data => {console.log(data);}, //Successful responses call the first callback.\n      err => {console.log(\'Got error!\'); //Errors - Something went wrong!\n});\n\nHow To Get and Log an error in Angular 4?\nTwo types of errors -\n1.

Each entry of the array is  The complete list of possible fields used in this configuration are as following:\n\npath Ã¢â‚¬â€œ url of the route used by the matcher DSL.\ncomponent Ã¢â‚¬â€œname of the target component.\npathMatch Ã¢â‚¬â€œ specifies the matching strategy, example : full.\nredirectTo -url that will replace the current matched segment in case of redirection.\noutlet Ã¢â‚¬â€œ name of the outlet used as a placeholder for the component.

Such as:\n\nrouter-outlet\nrouter-link\nrouterLinkActive\nrouter-outlet:\n\nrouter-outlet is a component from angular/router library. The router is the placeholder to display views inside  <router-outlet> tags. As the routes changes, the view inside the <router-outlet> tags also change accordingly.\n\n\n<div class=\"container-fluid\">\n        <router-outlet></router-outlet>\n</div>\n1\n2\n3\n<div class=\"container-fluid\">\n        <router-outlet></router-outlet>\n</div>\nrouter-link:\n\nrouter-link directive is an alternative of HTML href property. The syntax is as following:\n\n\n<a [routerLink]=\"[\'/url\']\">Url Title</a>\n1\n<a [routerLink]=\"[\'/url\']\">Url Title</a>\nrouter-link directive can also handle query parameter. For example, once we land in /hoem/events page, it shows a list of events , if we want to go to directly one of the events page, we can just put the iid of that specific event and can land of the event details page for event 01. For this purpose, we use [queryParams] binding. [queryParams] takes an object such as {Ã¢â‚¬ËœidÃ¢â‚¬â„¢:01} and can\n\nFirstly, We have bound router-link directive to events array as following:\n\n\n<a [routerLink]=\"[\'/home/events]\">Events</a>\n1\n<a [routerLink]=\"[\'/home/events]\">Events</a>\nNow inside app.router.ts we have configure the queryParams binding as following:\n\n\nthis.router.navigate([\'/home/events\', event.id]);\n1\nthis.router.navigate([\'/home/events\', event.id]);\nOtherwise, if we want to pass the queryParams in an object , we can also do that as following:\n\n\n<a [routerLink]=\"[\'/home/events, { id: \'event01\' }]\">Event 01 </a>\n\n<a [routerLink]=\"[\'/home/events, { id: \'event01\' }]\">Event 01 </a>\nOR\n\n\n<a [routerLink]=\"[\'/home/events, 1]\">Event 1</a>\n\n<a [routerLink]=\"[\'/home/events, 1]\">Event 1</a>\n\nrouterLinkActive:\n\nThe RouterLinkActive directive toggles css classes for active RouterLinks based on the current RouterState. This cascades down through each level in our route tree, so parent and child router links can be active at the same time. To override this behavior, we can bind to the [routerLinkActiveOptions] input binding with the { exact: true } expression. By using { exact: true }, a given RouterLink will only be active if its URL is an exact match to the current URL.\n\n\n\n',1),(812,7,'Metadata in Angularjs 2:','In Angular2.0, different decorators are used to pass variables to class.

LetÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s take a look in the detail changes!  Stayed Informed Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Angular 4 Q/A\n\nThe Components of Routing and Navigation -\n1.     Router Imports\n2.     Router Configuration\n3.     Router Outlet\n4.     Router Link\n5.     Router State\n6.     Router Events\n\nAngular Routing Overview -\n1.     Enter the URL in your address bar for your browser navigations.\n2.     Click on your navigations links on the page and the browser navigates to a new page which you have entered in the navigations URL.\n3.     Click the browsers back and forward buttons. The browser navigates backward and forward through the history of pages.\n\nRouter Imports- Angular Router is an optional service that presents a particular component view for a given URL i.e.\nimport { RouterModule, Routes } from \'@angular/router\';\n\nRouter Configuration -\nconst appRoutes: Routes = [\n  { path: \'\', redirectTo: \'home\', pathMatch: \'full\' },\n  { path: \'registration\', component: RegistrationComponent},\n  { path: \'login\', component: LoginComponent},\n  { path: \'\'home/:id\',      component: HomeComponent, data: { title: \'Home\' }},\n  { path: \'users\',    component: UserListComponent, data: { title: \'User List\' }},\n  { path: \'dashboard\', component: DashboardComponent, data: { title: \'Dashboard\' }}\n  { path: \'**\', component: PageNotFoundComponent }\n];\n\n@NgModule({\n  imports: [\n    UniversalModule, // MUST BE FIRST IMPORT.

Both the template and templateUrl render the components where you use this directive.\n\nSyntax Ã¢â‚¬â€œ\n<router-outlet></router-outlet>\n\nExample -\n<div class=\'container\'>   \n    <div class=\'row\'>\n        <router-outlet></router-outlet>\n    </div>\n</div>\n\nRouter Link - It is use to link to application\'s routes and Router-link directive is used to link a specific part of your applications.\n\nSyntax Ã¢â‚¬â€œ \n<router-link></router-link>\n\nExample Ã¢â‚¬â€œ\n<ul class=\'nav navbar-nav\'>\n    <li [routerLinkActive]=\"[\'link-active\']\">\n        <a [routerLink]=\"[\'/login\']\">\n            <span class=\'glyphicon glyphicon-Login\'></span> Login\n        </a>\n    </li>\n    <li [routerLinkActive]=\"[\'link-active\']\">\n        <a [routerLink]=\"[\'/registration\']\">\n            <span class=\'glyphicon glyphicon-Register\'></span> Register\n        </a>\n    </li>\n    <li [routerLinkActive]=\"[\'link-active\']\">\n        <a [routerLink]=\"[\'/Users\']\">\n            <span class=\'glyphicon glyphicon-Users\'></span> Users\n        </a>\n    </li>\n    <li [routerLinkActive]=\"[\'link-active\']\">\n        <a [routerLink]=\"[\'/Dashboard\']\">\n            <span class=\'glyphicon glyphicon-Dashboard\'></span> Dashboard\n        </a>\n    </li>\n</ul>\n\nRouter State -\nAfter the end of each successful navigation life-cycle, the router builds a tree of Activated-Route objects that make up the current state of the router. You can access the current Router-State from anywhere in the application using the Router service and the router-State property.\n\nEach Activated-Route in the Router-State provides methods to traverse up and down the route tree to get information from parent, child and sibling routes.\n\nRouter Events -\n1.     NavigationStart- This event is triggered when navigation starts.\n2.     RoutesRecognized - This event is triggered when Router parses the URL and routes are recognized.\n3.     RouteConfigLoadStart- This event is triggered before the Router lazy loads a route configuration.\n4.     RouteConfigLoadEnd - This event is triggered after a route has been lazy loaded.\n5.     NavigationEnd - This event is triggered when navigation ends successfully!\n6.     NavigationCancel - This event is triggered when navigation is cancelled.\n7.     NavigationError - This event is triggered when navigation fails due to error.\n\n\n\n\n',2),(833,7,'Angular 4 Error Handling - Logging, Retry Request and HttpCache!','\nWhat Happens If the Request fails on the Server Due to Poor Network Connection?\nHttpClient will return an error instead of a successful response.\n\nExample - Add an error handler to handle the errors\nhttp.get(\'/api/users\')\n  .subscribe(data => {console.log(data);}, //Successful responses call the first callback.\n      err => {console.log(\'Got error!\'); //Errors - Something went wrong!\n});\n\nHow To Get and Log an error in Angular 4?\nTwo types of errors -\n1.

Such as:\n\nrouter-outlet\nrouter-link\nrouterLinkActive\nrouter-outlet:\n\nrouter-outlet is a component from angular/router library. The router is the placeholder to display views inside  <router-outlet> tags.

For example, once we land in /hoem/events page, it shows a list of events , if we want to go to directly one of the events page, we can just put the iid of that specific event and can land of the event details page for event 01. For this purpose, we use [queryParams] binding. [queryParams] takes an object such as {â€˜idâ€™:01} and can\n\nFirstly, We have bound router-link directive to events array as following:\n\n\n<a [routerLink]=\"[\'/home/events]\">Events</a>\n1\n<a [routerLink]=\"[\'/home/events]\">Events</a>\nNow inside app.router.ts we have configure the queryParams binding as following:\n\n\nthis.router.navigate([\'/home/events\', event.id]);\n1\nthis.router.navigate([\'/home/events\', event.id]);\nOtherwise, if we want to pass the queryParams in an object , we can also do that as following:\n\n\n<a [routerLink]=\"[\'/home/events, { id: \'event01\' }]\">Event 01 </a>\n\n<a [routerLink]=\"[\'/home/events, { id: \'event01\' }]\">Event 01 </a>\nOR\n\n\n<a [routerLink]=\"[\'/home/events, 1]\">Event 1</a>\n\n<a [routerLink]=\"[\'/home/events, 1]\">Event 1</a>\n\nrouterLinkActive:\n\nThe RouterLinkActive directive toggles css classes for active RouterLinks based on the current RouterState. This cascades down through each level in our route tree, so parent and child router links can be active at the same time. To override this behavior, we can bind to the [routerLinkActiveOptions] input binding with the { exact: true } expression.

Router Outlet\n4.     Router Link\n5.     Router State\n6.     Router Events\n\nAngular Routing Overview -\n1.     Enter the URL in your address bar for your browser navigations.\n2.     Click on your navigations links on the page and the browser navigates to a new page which you have entered in the navigations URL.\n3.     Click the browsers back and forward buttons. The browser navigates backward and forward through the history of pages.\n\nRouter Imports- Angular Router is an optional service that presents a particular component view for a given URL i.e.\nimport { RouterModule, Routes } from \'@angular/router\';\n\nRouter Configuration -\nconst appRoutes: Routes = [\n  { path: \'\', redirectTo: \'home\', pathMatch: \'full\' },\n  { path: \'registration\', component: RegistrationComponent},\n  { path: \'login\', component: LoginComponent},\n  { path: \'\'home/:id\',      component: HomeComponent, data: { title: \'Home\' }},\n  { path: \'users\',    component: UserListComponent, data: { title: \'User List\' }},\n  { path: \'dashboard\', component: DashboardComponent, data: { title: \'Dashboard\' }}\n  { path: \'**\', component: PageNotFoundComponent }\n];\n\n@NgModule({\n  imports: [\n    UniversalModule, // MUST BE FIRST IMPORT.

Both the template and templateUrl render the components where you use this directive.\n\nSyntax â€“\n<router-outlet></router-outlet>\n\nExample -\n<div class=\'container\'>   \n    <div class=\'row\'>\n        <router-outlet></router-outlet>\n    </div>\n</div>\n\nRouter Link - It is use to link to application\'s routes and Router-link directive is used to link a specific part of your applications.\n\nSyntax â€“ \n<router-link></router-link>\n\nExample â€“\n<ul class=\'nav navbar-nav\'>\n    <li [routerLinkActive]=\"[\'link-active\']\">\n        <a [routerLink]=\"[\'/login\']\">\n            <span class=\'glyphicon glyphicon-Login\'></span> Login\n        </a>\n    </li>\n    <li [routerLinkActive]=\"[\'link-active\']\">\n        <a [routerLink]=\"[\'/registration\']\">\n            <span class=\'glyphicon glyphicon-Register\'></span> Register\n        </a>\n    </li>\n    <li [routerLinkActive]=\"[\'link-active\']\">\n        <a [routerLink]=\"[\'/Users\']\">\n            <span class=\'glyphicon glyphicon-Users\'></span> Users\n        </a>\n    </li>\n    <li [routerLinkActive]=\"[\'link-active\']\">\n        <a [routerLink]=\"[\'/Dashboard\']\">\n            <span class=\'glyphicon glyphicon-Dashboard\'></span> Dashboard\n        </a>\n    </li>\n</ul>\n\nRouter State -\nAfter the end of each successful navigation life-cycle, the router builds a tree of Activated-Route objects that make up the current state of the router. You can access the current Router-State from anywhere in the application using the Router service and the router-State property.\n\nEach Activated-Route in the Router-State provides methods to traverse up and down the route tree to get information from parent, child and sibling routes.\n\nRouter Events -\n1.     NavigationStart- This event is triggered when navigation starts.\n2.     RoutesRecognized - This event is triggered when Router parses the URL and routes are recognized.\n3.     RouteConfigLoadStart- This event is triggered before the Router lazy loads a route configuration.\n4.     RouteConfigLoadEnd - This event is triggered after a route has been lazy loaded.\n5.     NavigationEnd - This event is triggered when navigation ends successfully!\n6.     NavigationCancel - This event is triggered when navigation is cancelled.\n7.

The framework is in charge and it calls into your code when it needs something app specific. E.g., durandal, ember, etc.\n\nAngularJS takes another approach. It attempts to minimize the impedance mismatch between document centric HTML and what an application needs by creating new HTML constructs. AngularJS teaches the browser new syntax through a construct we call directives.
